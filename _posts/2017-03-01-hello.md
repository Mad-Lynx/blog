## Greetings

For a very long time I wanted to start a blog. But lack of time was always keeping me away from doing it. 
I realised that if you want something - there are no excuses. You just have to start, and you will find time.

So I set my goals, and here we are, my first blogpost.

## Why?

OK, but why I even wanted to write a blog in the first place? Let me first quote some really bright and clever guys:

Did you know any of these quotes? Or do you know these guys? If your answer was 'no', you have a lot to catch up on.

First quote from _Martin Fowler_ is one of my favourite ones. It's ideally describing meaning of refactoring and keeping your code tided up (clean and sharp).
When I do something, I always want to do my best... I always care...  
So I always put emphasis on writing code which not only works, but it could be easily maintained afterwards.
Maybe your client will not see and appreciate your work, but other developers will,
so you should take any effort to write clean, **sharp code** that other devs can easily read.

## What next?

In future posts I will talk about how to write such code, how to "infect" your team with good practice.
I will try to show real-life examples, where implementing feature in legacy code (without refactoring) would take days,
but after refactoring bits and pieces it can be done by changing just few lines.

But not all my posts will be just about clean code. There will be some technical ones (how to implement something or go deep into IL)
or just my reflection on life :P

I hope everyone will find something here. So enjoy reading.
