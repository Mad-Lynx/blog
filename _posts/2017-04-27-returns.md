A couple of weeks ago I had this conversation with my colleague, and a few days ago with another one. So I decided to "put words on paper", because apparently more people have this doubt.

# Pros/cons

Let me start by pointing out some pros and cons for each method:

Pros for SEP:

- if method has many exits, it's hard to know what path leads to the returning value
- if method use resources and we have to release them before exit, we have to duplicate code
- adding additional exit points can unintentionally change the logic

Pros for EE:

- braking nested loop to get only one return, can lead to more complex code
- if we have lots of conditions we could ended up with big indentation if we want to use single return
- if some initial conditions are not valid, we can just skip execution of the method entirely
- SEP is very old principle


And now, lets consider each point separately and with some examples.

It's a lot of text and code, so you can just jump straight to [Summary](#summary) if you get bored with it ;)


## 1) Path to the returning value

```c#
SpecialObj Method()
{
    if (AnyOffspringExists())
    {
        var parent = this;
        while (parent != null)
        {
            if (parent.Parent == this.MasterParent)
            {
                return parent;
            }
            parent = parent.Parent;
        }
        return null;
    }

    if (IsMammal() || IsAmphibian())
    {
        if (this.Parent != null)
            return this.Parent.GetFirstChild();

        return this;
    }

    return null;
}
```
The code above looks very messy, and the code is much better to read, when it looks like this: 

```c#
SpecialObj Method()
{
    SpecialObj parent = null;

    if (AnyOffspringExists())
    {
        parent = this;
        while (parent != null)
        {
            if (parent.Parent == this.MasterParent)
                break;

            parent = parent.Parent;
        }
    }
    else if (IsMammal() || IsAmphibian())
    {
        parent = this.Parent != null
            ? this.Parent.GetFirstChild()
            : this;
    }

    return parent;
}
```

But what about this one?

``` c#
SpecialObj Method()
{
    if (AnyOffspringExists())
        return GetParentFromChild();

    if (IsMammal() || IsAmphibian())
        return GetParentFirstChild;

    return null;
}

SpecialObj GetParentFirstChild()
{
    if (this.Parent != null)
        return this.Parent.GetFirstChild();

    return this;
}

SpecialObj GetParentFromChild()
{
    var parent = this;
    while (parent != null)
    {
        if (parent.Parent == this.MasterParent)
            return parent;

        parent = parent.Parent;
    }

    return null;
}
```

We only extracted some code to the different methods. We still have multiple exit points, but because each method is small and we use meaningful names, it's also clear.  
Although the code would be almost the same if we used `break` and SEP in `GetParentFromChild()`, now we clearly see that we will return `null`.


## 2) Duplicate code

```c#
int Method()
{
    var con = new SomeConnection();

    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        if (con.TrySendFile())
        {
            con.SetLastTime();
            con.CloseConnection();
            return i;
        }
    }

    con.SetLastTime();
    con.CloseConnection();
    return -1;
}
```
If we open some file or connection before we leave the method, we have to close it (release the resources). And it's true, now we have duplicated code, which we all should avoid - [DRY]{:target="_blank"}!

But, come on, we are using C# _(at least I am :P)_ so we should take advantage of the `using` statement and 'IDisposible' interface or `try/finally`.  
Other modern languages are also good with resource management, so there should be some special syntax to deal with that case.

We can write this code as follows:

```c#
int Method()
{
    using (var db = new SomeConnection())
    {
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            if (db.TrySendFile())
                return i;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

## 3) Maintenance problem
Even if we have simple and clean code after a while we can add a new return and unintentionally change the logic.  
Consider this simple code:

```c#
string Method(string fileName)
{
    if (!ContainsDriveLetter(fileName))
        return DefaultDrive + fileName;

    CorrectFiles++;
    return fileName;
}
```
Simple logic - if we don't have a drive letter we will add a default one and we will not increment the counter.

Later we have to add an additional check for removing invalid characters. If we decide to do this, we will perform an additional process which will remove unwanted characters.

```c#
string Method(string fileName, bool removeInvalidChars = false)
{
    if (!ContainsDriveLetter(fileName))
        return DefaultDrive + fileName;

    if (removeInvalidChars)
        return AdditionalProcess(fileName);

    CorrectFiles++;
    return fileName;
}
```

So the code looks OK. But in reality it isn't. Because now if we pass `true` we will never increment our counter.

If from the beginning we would follow SEP, we would design the logic differently and the counter will have the proper value.

There is no good remedy for "early exit lovers", just be always aware when changing some code.  
And when you add a new `return` statement, keep in mind my comment below, about Guard Clauses.

## 4) Nested loops
If we have two loops and at some point we want to break out and return some value, this will be more complex with just single return.

```c#
int Method()
{
    var id = -1;
    foreach (var sibling in Siblings)
    {
        foreach (var child in sibling.Children)
        {
            if (child.Age > 18)
            {
                id = child.Id;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (id != -1)
            break;
    }

    return id;
}
```

Using early exit, we can skip the whole breaking part and just return the value as soon as we know it.

```c#
int Method()
{
    foreach (var sibling in Siblings)
    {
        foreach (var child in sibling.Children)
        {
            if (child.Age > 18)
                return child.Id;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

## 5) Big indentation

Instead of this:

```c#
int Method()
{
    int result;

    if (_isAlive)
    {
        AddAnotherYear();

        if (_isWorking)
        {
            result = GetCompany();
        }
        else
        {
            if (_isYoung)
            {
                result = GetSchool();
            }
            else
            {
                GiveToys();
                result = GetPlayground();
            }
        }
    }
    else
    {
        result = GetCemetery();
    }

    return result;
}
```

We can write:

```c#
int Method()
{
    // or use _isDead
    if (!_isAlive)
        return GetCemetery();

    AddAnotherYear();

    if (_isWorking)
        return GetCompany();

    if (_isYoung)
        return GetSchool();

    GiveToys();
    return GetPlayground();
}
```
We can see the obvious advantage of using the early exit in this case. Even though this example is exaggerated a "little". This approach can be called "[Guard Clauses]{:target="_blank"}".

Someone can raise the issue, that "now, we don't know the relation between `_isWorking` and `_isYoung`". But we **do**. 

> Every time we "enter" the guard, everything below is **irrelevant**.

## 6) Skip execution

I will not write much here, because even adversaries agree that checking the preconditions at the beginning of the method is helpful and in this case they allow this.  
Having said this, in many cases not meeting the precondition should lead to throwing an exception.

```c#
void Method(string fileName)
{
    if (!File.Exists(fileName))
        return;

    // Do some complicated operations
}
```

## 7) Ternary operator is better

Of course sometimes using single return is more readable:

```c#
string Method(string fileName)
{
    return File.Exists(fileName)
        ? File.ReadAllText(fileName)
        : String.Empty;
}
```

But code like this, IMHO, looks better with three returns:

```c#
string Method(string fileName)
{
    if (!File.Exists(fileName))
        return String.Empty;

    if (IsRestrictedFile(fileName))
        return "***";

    return File.ReadAllText(fileName);
}
```

## 8) Historical artifact

You can find information that the SEP or SESE (Single Entry, Single Exit) principle was first created in the early 1970s for structured programming. So because we evolved beyond structured programming we should ignore it.

The year has nothing to do with the decision to ignore it.

Many principles and ideas that we're using today or that emerged in recent years were created in '60-'80.

If we want to discount this idea, we should do it because it's no longer relevant to modern technologies.

So keep this in mind: there is _no good or bad approach_ to this problem. Both can be used and both should be used. It always depends where you want to use it and how.

If the surrounding code is badly-written, either choice will be "the wrong choice".
