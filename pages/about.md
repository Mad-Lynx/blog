I'm a professional C# programmer with 10+ years of professional experience. I usually work with business applications and large solutions.
In projects like this, there is lots of legacy code and maintaining these projects is sometimes hard.  
This is why I'm writing this blog. 

I'm curious by nature and from the beginning I was looking at .NET source code (back in .NET1.1 it was a little bit harder than now).
I never take something for granted - I had to understand _how_ something works. This is why IL and low level programming was always close to my heart.

After work, I like to move - freeride on bicycle, rollerblading, climbing, dancing. These are just a few examples how I like to "stretch my legs" after work at the desk.
